# Data-science: Dialect map server

This repository contains the web server to access the database information.

It will be used in combination with the original PaperScape server, in order to
construct colored areas over the [Dialect map UI][dialect-map-ui] interface,
given the papers categorization over a pair of user specified jargon words frequencies.
